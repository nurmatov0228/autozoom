              One of the main reasons to hire a car in Dubai is the quality of
              the UAE roads. According to the World Economic Forum, the Emirates
              belong to the top seven countries with the most exemplary road
              infrastructure. All the roads and carriageways are constantly
              maintained and looked after, and their excellent condition is the
              result of a special government program. This is why driving from
              Dubai to far away destinations seems so exciting and thrilling!
              And if you are fond of new experiences and adventure, your Dubai
              holiday will not be complete without visiting a few fascinating
              UAE districts. <br /> <br /> Abu-Dhabi

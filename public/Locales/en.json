The number of places you will die to go to and make memorable pictures is such that it makes you impossible to resist hiring a mode of transportation, if not for a day or two, then at least for a couple of hours. And, while doing so, who could resist the urge to take a photo inside or near the car they’ve rented?",

According to the World Economic Forum, the Emirates belong to the top seven countries with the most exemplary road infrastructure. All the roads and carriageways are constantly maintained and looked after, and their excellent condition is the result of a special government program. This is why driving from Dubai to far away destinations seems so exciting and thrilling! And if you are fond of new experiences and adventure, your Dubai holiday will not be complete without visiting a few fascinating UAE districts.",

  "topDestinationsText2": "If the combination of adventure and history is one of your personal weaknesses, then Hatta should never be off your list of primary destinations. A journey that takes only a couple of hours will bring you to a noticeably cooler mountainous climate. Thanks to its high-altitude location among the beautiful Hajar Mountains, the sense of space and release you will feel here after the suffocating heat of Dubai is what you really need for a change and fresh impressions. This trip will broaden your Emirates experience as it lets you explore an absolutely different area with remarkable features that include, but are not limited to, the greenness of the vast Wadi Hatta Park, the enormity of the world's largest inclined mural, the birdlife diversity of the Swan Lake, and a grand spaciousness of Hatta Dam offering everyone to take an active part in various watersport experiences. It would be a gorgeous bonus if you try to extend your visit with an overnight stay in one of the Hatta hotels, motels, and resorts. This will save you from a sense of missed opportunities and allow you to enjoy the lavish local hospitality and its distinctive cuisine. Treat yourself with memorable outdoor activities such as mountainous hiking and biking, a thrilling paragliding flight over endemic peaks, valleys, and plateaus, or take an insightful tour to the marvelous Honeybee Garden and Discovery Center.",
